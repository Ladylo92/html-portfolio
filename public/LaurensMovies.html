<h2>Top Three Faves</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Apocalypto</h3>
<p>It's such an intriguing adventure and has traces of historical truth. It takes you through all the emotions of sadness, happiness, fear, excitement, anger, etc. And it will leave you in awe of the main characters' bravery and ability to survive. It is definitely a must watch, but be prepared to read subtitles as the entire movie is in a fictional foreign language</p>
<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>Easily one of the greatest modern horror movies in existance. It was very frightening and realistic. It had great acting which a lot of horror movies lack, and the production was top tier. It's also based on true events which adds an extra element of horror. And the spin off movie, Annabelle, is another honorable mention. </p>
<h3>Silent Hill</h3>
<p>This is one of my all time favorite horror films! It's about a girl and her mom who go to an abandoned ghost town called Silent Hill where they see all sorts of scary things. The girl ends up lost and the mom is looking for her for most of the movie along with a cop and they run into all sorts of scary people and creatures along the way and then discover her daughter has a twin who really isn't her twin at all but is a dark evil part of her child's spirit that was left to wreak havoc on the town as revenge for being burned alive. It's a lot to unpack, which is why you must watch it! The storyline is very interesting.</p>
